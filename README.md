Global Wish List an app for someone who enjoys making other people happy.

Overview

Users can search for a known or random individual, and by using the "View" button, they can see what the person is wishing for and decide whether or not they want to grant those wishes.


App Features

- By clicking the "interested" button, users can express their interest in fulfilling someone else's wish. The button's click will change the heart's color to yellow.

- The wish owner can also see that the button was clicked from their dashboard.
- Wish owners can create wish cards as much as they like.
- If a wish is fulfilled by someone, the wish owner can click the "satisfied" button, and the heart color will be changed to green. This will be shown on their public profile, too.
