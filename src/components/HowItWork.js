        <br />
        <p>
          Global Wish List web app links all people on the planet. GWL is the
          ideal online app for you if you have the ability to brighten someone's
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          To view someone's wishes, you can search for them by name, nation,
          state, or city, or you can choose a random individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          By clicking the "interested" button, you can let the wish owner know
          that you're interested in granting their desire. The heart will then
          turn yellow ("ðŸ’›"), and you can get in touch with them using the user
          information you've been given.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the heart is green ( "ðŸ’š"), their wish has already been granted.
        </p>
